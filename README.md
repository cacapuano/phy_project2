# phy_project2

Our project is a package that implements Runge-Kutta method to approach a Tritium wavefunction solution to its 2nd order
Schrodinger's Equation. Then, we use Monte Carlo simulation with the position probability 
density function to make a wavefunction plot at the end of the project. 

## Table of Contents

- for a hydrogen-like atom, the n=1 eigenfunction looks like a smooth bell shape, corresponding 
to our knowledge of quantum mechanics.
- this project requires you to installl the below apps:
1. pip install numpy
2. pip install matplotlib
3. pip install schrodinger_eqn or pip install .
- The project can be used to approach a tritium wavefuncton inside an infinite or finite well.
- Caroline, Jasmine
- We have PHY607 license.

## Features

- Feature 1: It plots a simulated tritium wave function and an actual solution to compare. 
- Feature 2: The center point (x = 0.5) is where you mostly likely will find tritium. 
- Feature 3: There is a small shift from simulated plot and the actual plot. 

1. Package is schrodinger_eqn, and wavefunction
2. To get our simulated probability density plot, run python Wavefuction.py
3. To get our comparison of the acual and simulated probability density plots, run python schrodinger_eqn.py
4. To run the error plot, run python error_plot

## Installation
