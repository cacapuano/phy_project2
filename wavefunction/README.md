# Project Title

This package is to implements Monte Carlo simulation to approach a Tritium 
wavefunction. 

## Table of Contents

- for a hydrogen-like atom, the n=1 eigenfunction looks like a smooth bell shape, corresponding 
to our knowledge of quantum mechanics.
- this project requires you to installl the below apps:
1. pip install numpy
2. pip install matplotlib
3. pip install wavefunction or pip install .
- The project can be used to approach a tritium wavefuncton using Monte Carlo simulation.
- Caroline, Jasmine
- We have PHY607 license.

## Features

- Feature 1: It plots a simulated tritium wave function of tritum using Monte Carlo simulation. 
- Feature 2: The center point (x = 0.5) is where you mostly likely will find tritium. 
- Feature 3: The probability density integrates to 1, which is wihthin our knowledge.  

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
